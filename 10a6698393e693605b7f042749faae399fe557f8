The `QueryMaker` interface is defined in the parents package and is, therefore, not SQL specific. This class is in the `sql` package: can it work with any `QueryMaker` implementation or can it only work with (queries made by) the `SqlQueryMaker`?\n\nIf it can work with any `QueryMaker` implementation then the `QueryMaker` interface belongs to the `sql` package too.\n\nIf it is not guaranteed to work with all `QueryMaker` implementations, then this class should rather depend on the `SqlQueryMaker`.",
